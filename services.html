                <h4>HOME LOAN</h4>
                <p>To make your home loan journey a smooth sail, in this article we will help you to know eligibility criteria, rates of interest, process, necessary documents, EMI comparison and transfer for lowest rates. Home loan is really critical and important financial decision in our lives.  Before you finalise your bank to secure home loan, try to get more information on current interest rates from different banks. First, gather some more information about how much each bank can give you. Find out eligibility for government and private banks. Which interest rate is more flexible and affordable such as fixed rates or floating rates? What is more easy a prepay option or balance transfer? We try to give answers to all such questions, and make this home loan process simple for you.
                <br><br>To find the lender for 20 years term go through the fine print and save for years to come. A perfect Home loan is loan which gives you lowest rates throughout the tenure, has part payment options and allows you to balance transfer if you wish to.</p>
                <h4>HOME LOAN BALANCE TRANSFER</h4>
                <p>Home Loan Balance Transfer helps you reduce your EMIs by moving your outstanding loan from other financial institutes to the one which offers lower interest rate. Home Loan Balance Transfer or Refinancing or simply Balance Transfer is the process that allows
                  you to benefit from the lower interest rate offered by the other lender. If you have an existing outstanding home loan with one borrower, you can make a home loan transfer, that is, shift the remainder amount to a different borrower who charges a lower rate of interest, the process is termed as a home loan balance transfer or refinancing.

                  <p>This unique home loan transfer service helps a customer avoid high applicable interest rates as listed by one home loan lender and migrate to a lower interest rate structure with another lender. So why one would need a balance transfer? A home loan involves a significantly large amount of money and therefore, the interest rate on the loan is a matter of concern for everyone who decides to take a home loan. Home loan interest rates may range from 6.80 % to 12 % and one of the most common ways to reduce interest rates is to either talk to the bank that has provided you the loan to reduce it or go for a transfer of the balance on existing home loan or in layman terms, shift your home loan to a bank offering lesser rate.

                    <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" ></i> Do not at any circumstance give any false information. This may amount to fraud and could land you in trouble.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" ></i> Do not sign any blank documents. Even if it takes you a few hours to fill-up the form, please do so. Do not leave anything for the executive to fill-up.</li>
